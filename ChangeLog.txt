*Fixed - ANY/ALL/NOT Condition Landblock and Landcell default to 0000000 when editing*

**Features**
*IN - Have save option instead of SaveAs (No more SaveDialog if working on same XML)*
*IN - Added Listbox with common VT options, True False Radio Buttons.  You can Use the True/False options on all Options (even those not in list).  However there is no logic, So if option requires a value other than True/False, Meta will fail in Vtank.*

Major Update. 
All Double Value Conditions and Actions have been added. (ex Items count less than, Chat Capture, VT Option Get/Set, etc.)
Fixed several bugs related to selecting blank row and then when selecting populated row, fields would not appear/populate correctly.
Eliminated Insert Rule - It is no longer needed, as create rule does the same thing, since it autosorts now, and can create multiple rules quickly.
Only a few things left, ANY/ALL  & Seconds in State Persist Conditions, and ALL, Embeded Nav routes, Watchdogs and the 3 Views (Not sure if I will even put them in, as they are not used much.)
I have tested all Double Values, and they work as single rules.  I have not tested serveral rules at a time, but they should work.
Needs testing.
