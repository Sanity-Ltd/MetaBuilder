5/30/17 Notes:
This is a super early Alpha release.  This is just to get a handle on interface, suggestions (not that I will listen :p) etc..
EXE is a Debug version.
Works on Win10, may work on Win 7 with correct .net framework (ver 4.0 or higher) but have not tested it

Several things don't work:
You can only add a few conditions, and actions. (More to come)
You can only have one rule per state Example: Any and All Conditions and Actions (Hopefully)
Rules don't sort yet by Meta State in alphabetical order, you will have to do this manually (Feature coming)
For some reason, loading, saving an XML deletes the last row (still tracking that one down)
Sometimes after loading a saved XML, you are unable to add rules (Just found that one)

Things that work:
Export Meta does work, however I have only tested it a few times under basic conditions.
Save XML does work, but last rule is not being saved
Loading works, but again, last rule is not loading into datatable
You can save default directories for saving XML and exporting Meta Files in the Tools --> Options Menu
