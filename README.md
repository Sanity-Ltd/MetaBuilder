# MetaBuilder
Mission Impossible Meta Builder - For creating VTank Metas
It's written in VB, and truthfully a lot of the code is crap. (yea I know, wish I had done it in C#, but I had not done much programming in 13 years prior to this)
I started this project way back in 2015.  I haven't messed with it in about a year (2017). I also included the spreadsheets used to decode the meta format used by VTank.  If you want to mess with it, by all means have at it.
